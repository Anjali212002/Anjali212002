PROBLEM STATEMENT:

              The use of data and information becomes increasingly crucial for the
              agriculture sector to improve productivity and sustainability.
              Information and Communication Technology (ICT) substantially increases 
              the effectiveness and efficiency of collecting, storing, analyzing and
              using data in agriculture.
              It allows agricultural practitioners and farming communities
              to easily obtain update-to-date information and thus make better
              decisions in their daily farming .
